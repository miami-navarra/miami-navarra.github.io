      <p>
        Many of humanity’s most challenging issues are shaped by cross-border
        forces that affect people’s lives in ways that adapt to local histories,
        social structures, natural ecologies, and political institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to address – and report on – these issues, collaboration is
        critical. That is why the <strong>University of Miami</strong> and the
        <strong>University of Navarra</strong> came together to create the
        “Covering Global Issues in Miami” course.

        guided students on an intellectual and experiential journey of
        investigation, discovery and learning about grounded globalization and
        how it should be communicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortified with this knowledge, students practiced their technical and
        critical storytelling skills through collaborative, multimedia
        journalism projects that have the potential to facilitate wider
        understanding and action.
