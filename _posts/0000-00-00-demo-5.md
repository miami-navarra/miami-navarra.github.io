## The Unbroken Tide: José María Rincón's Journey Towards Liberty




In the tumultuous landscape of Fidel Castro's Cuba, where the oppressive regime reigned supreme, José María Rincón found himself trapped in a relentless cycle of fear and suppression. Like countless others, he was unable to express dissent against the regime's iron fist without facing the grim consequences of imprisonment. The communist regime dictated every aspect of life, leaving the Cuban people devoid of freedom and enduring the pangs of starvation while their rulers blamed capitalism and touted a fictitious external blockade.

Rincón's harrowing journey to freedom began in 1980, during the historic Mariel boatlift—a mass exodus of Cubans seeking refuge in the United States. Offered an opportunity to escape the clutches of the Cuban regime, he embarked on a treacherous voyage aboard a vessel named Raulito. Little did he know that the owner of the boat, also seeking freedom for his family, had been coerced into transporting prisoners. Miraculously, Rincón managed to flee before the authorities sent the boat back to Cuba, sealing the fate of those left behind. 


Living in Fidel's Cuba, in the communist regime, is like living in hell," shares José María Rincón, his voice laden with the weight of his experiences. "You couldn't express yourself against the system because they put you in jail. You couldn't buy anything from outside either because you were also in prison. It is an oppressive dictatorial regime that keeps the Cuban people without freedom and starving. They have been with the ration card for 64 years, and they blame capitalism. They say there is a blockage. But they do the blockade against the Cuban people, who oppress them. That is the real blockade, not the one of the USA."


José María Rincón's journey is not merely one of seeking a better life; it is a tale of survival and resilience in the face of political persecution. Recalling his time as a political prisoner, he shares, "At that time, when I was 23 years old, I worked in Cuba in a tire company. I was apathetic to the communist system, I never belonged to the youth or to the party, so they didn't look upon me well at the factory. They even kicked me out of the baseball team I was playing on for not being sympathetic to the regime." Rincón's life took a fateful turn when he became entangled in false accusations. "Then there was a problem with a Japanese product, the dye for rubber bands. It was spoiled. I had nothing to do with it, but in order not to catch the real culprits, who belonged to the party, they caught me. They asked for twenty four years for embezzlement of state assets, and the opposing lawyer was a first captain in the army. Go figure," Rincón recounts with a hint of resignation. "The court was benevolent, according to them, and they only gave me twelve years. Twelve years for fun, I said. I remember that they told me not to protest or they’d make me do the full sentence. I entered prison at twenty-three and left at thirty-four. I was a year away from leaving in 1980, and that was when my mother came to tell me to run away and flee to the United States."  


Arriving in a foreign land, José María Rincón faced the daunting task of rebuilding his life from scratch. Yet, he was not alone in his struggle. "From Key West, I went to Pennsylvania, to Indiantown, trying to locate my brother who was here, but I couldn't locate him because we were disconnected," Rincón recounts. "The Church helped me, I explained the situation to them, and they managed to contact him, and after 3 months, we were able to talk. I was just going to go to Australia because, of course, I had been looking for months but I couldn't find anything. My brother claimed me, and they took me by plane to Miami. And here I have stayed."


Witnessing the evolution of his newfound home, Rincón acknowledges the profound impact of the Cuban immigrant community. "It has changed a lot," he observes. "Since the 80s, there were only Cubans here. Now, there are all nationalities. The Cubans developed this a lot with small businesses and customs, but there are already many nationalities." Little Havana, in particular, holds a special place in the hearts of Cuban immigrants. Rincón describes the vibrant atmosphere, where Spanish is the dominant language and a sense of familiarity pervades. "Very few places do not speak Spanish, and in the businesses, there are almost no Americans, they are all Hispanic."


Years after finding refuge in the United States, Rincón found himself drawn into clandestine organizations, their names left unspoken. The perils of their resistance work were underscored by the need for constant vigilance. "Every time the government caught one of us, they had to throw away all the information, the weapons, the clothes... anything they could link you to. Of course, we couldn't do anything like that," he shares, a somber reminder of the risks endured in pursuit of a free Cuba.


"And although he has great affection for the country that has given him so much, he does not forget the government's actions regarding Cuba," states José María Rincón, his voice tinged with a mix of admiration and disappointment. "Cuba is backed by the USA against any war action against Cuba, with the Kennedy-Khrushchev treaty, during the missile crisis. The USSR said that no one should go to Cuba, that no country could invade Cuba. There have been people who have tried to bring weapons there, but the government has not helped at all."


Rincón's gaze becomes focused, his words carrying a weighty sorrow as he recalls a painful chapter in Cuban history. "The US government betrayed the Cuban people by betraying the 2506 Assault Brigade. They were a group of Cuban guerrillas for the freedom of Cuba trained by the Government. But they released them in a place that was not the one established, and without giving them support. A group of 2000 people were abandoned. That was a betrayal that is engraved in the hearts of Cubans because if President Kennedy had not betrayed us, Cuba would not have communism today."


Despite the physical distance, Rincón's heart remains tethered to his homeland, the country he longs for and mourns. "I had my parents in Cuba, I couldn't go to the funeral nor did I see them again since I left, and a sister and a brother are still there," he confides, his voice heavy with longing. "The current situation is unfeasible. I help them when I can, I send aid packages or money. I'm already retired, and his worker's salary is 3,000 pesos a month, which is rubbish, and people there are hungry and in need. But I'm not talking about old people, but about young people. If you look at the border, they are all young people who have realized that the system does not work. From above, they are stubborn that the system is good. A system with which you cannot eat and in which families have their children starve and imprison people as they please."


While grateful for the life he has built in his adopted country, Rincón's heart yearns for a different reality. "I am delighted and happy to live here. I have children and grandchildren here. I can't go back to Cuba because they won't let me, but I'm fine here," he states, a hint of nostalgia coloring his words. "Now, if they tell me that communism is over in Cuba, tomorrow I'll take a plane there to die in Cuba. The land of my heart is Cuba."


José María Rincón's journey serves as a testament to the complexities of immigrant experiences and the enduring ties that bind individuals to their homeland. As we listen to his words, we are reminded of the ongoing struggles faced by those left behind and the unwavering hope for a Cuba free from the shackles of oppression. Through his story, Rincón beckons us to confront the injustices that persist and to strive for a world where all people can live in dignity and freedom.


With the weight of a wrongful conviction and the longing for freedom propelling him, Rincón made the courageous decision to seize his chance for a new beginning. “I worked here for 35 years, and today I have all the benefits of being a citizen. I am very grateful to this country; it is my second homeland," he declares with heartfelt appreciation.


José María Rincón's story serves as a stark reminder of the resilience and determination that can arise even in the darkest of circumstances. From the depths of an oppressive regime to the shores of a new land, he has traversed a path fraught with obstacles, emerging as a symbol of hope and perseverance.


As we contemplate his journey, we are compelled to reflect on the countless individuals who still yearn for freedom in Cuba, trapped in the clutches of a regime that stifles their voices and hinders their dreams. Rincón's testimony serves as a powerful testament to the importance of upholding human rights and advocating for the rights and dignity of all individuals.


Today, José María Rincón stands as a living embodiment of the American dream, a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who seek a brighter future and the transformative power of resilience. Through his unwavering determination and unwavering faith, he serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, the human spirit can soar above the confines of oppression and build a life of freedom and opportunity.


As we bid farewell to this extraordinary man, let us carry his story in our hearts, acknowledging the struggles and triumphs that have shaped his life. May his journey inspire us to stand against injustice, support those who seek liberation, and work tirelessly towards a world where freedom and human dignity prevail, unencumbered by the chains of oppression.








## Resilient Tides: Julio Gálvez's Journey from Cuba to Miami




In the vibrant city of Miami, amidst its bustling streets and diverse communities, lies the remarkable story of Julio Gálvez, a Cuban scholar who defied the odds and left an indelible mark on both his homeland and adopted country. His journey, fraught with hardships and propelled by determination, serves as a testament to the human spirit and the power of education.


Born and raised in Cuba, Julio Gálvez experienced the harsh realities of a nation grappling with a struggling economy. Undeterred by the gloomy conditions, he pursued his passion for physical culture and sports, ultimately achieving a degree in the field. Through perseverance and resilience, Julio not only became a respected professor in the physical culture faculty but also ascended to the prestigious position of dean.


"For political reasons I had to leave the country. But my results stay there," Julio recounts. His departure from Cuba meant leaving behind cherished accomplishments and students. However, his legacy endures. During a recent visit to his homeland, Julio reunited with former students and teachers, affirming the lasting impact of his dedication and teachings. While he refrains from delving into the political situation, he proudly acknowledges the significant contributions he made to his beloved country.


Julio's arrival in Miami, two decades ago, marked the beginning of a new chapter. "We left at 1 am from the north coast of Cuba, near where I lived, and sailed all that night and morning, arriving at a cove near Key West at 9 am," Julio recalls. Their journey by sea was perilous, but they were fortunate to arrive safely. The United States government, recognizing the plight of Cuban immigrants, extended a warm welcome and provided them with essential benefits.


"The USA has a series of laws in relation to Cubans. The Government welcomed us and took care of us, gave us the benefits that were ours at that time," Julio explains. Adjusting to life in a new country presented its own set of challenges, most notably the language barrier. Julio and his fellow immigrants had to learn English. "I don't really speak perfect English, but I communicate without a problem," he shares, emphasizing the determination to overcome this obstacle.


Nestled within Miami's vibrant streets, the neighborhood of Little Havana stands as a testament to the tenacity and entrepreneurial spirit of Cuban immigrants. "Little Havana is a place where in the 60s the Cubans who were arriving were received in that area," Julio explains. Cuban entrepreneurs established businesses, creating a vibrant community. Today, Little Havana thrives as a renowned tourist destination, thanks to the contributions of the Cuban community.


Julio's love for his homeland is evident. "I cannot say that I am 100 percent Cuban. I am 150 percent," he declares. His pride in his Cuban identity is shared by countless others. Julio carries a symbol of his country wherever he goes, not to promote Cuba, but to let people know where he comes from. It is a source of immense pride for him, an opportunity to showcase the beauty and resilience of his homeland.


Reflecting on his extraordinary journey, Julio recognizes the complexities surrounding Cuba's political situation. "The political situation in the world, the longing that many people have to seize Cuba, and current Cuban politics, I don't think it will have immediate results," he reflects. Undeterred, Julio plans to chronicle his experiences and insights in an autobiography. His desire to document the traditions, humor, and distinctive aspects of Cuba is fueled by a deep-rooted love for his homeland and a commitment to preserving its rich cultural heritage. "First, I will finish my autobiography," Julio asserts, emphasizing the importance of sharing his story and shedding light on the untold narratives of Cuba.


Julio's remarkable journey is not solely his own; it represents the broader narrative of Cuban immigration to the United States. He pays homage to Operation Peter Pan, an initiative that assisted Cuban children and provided them with opportunities to flourish in their new home. "The Peter pans are already over 70 years old when they arrived when they were 5 or 6 years old. Of that, we are very proud," Julio states, acknowledging the lasting impact of the program.


While Julio acknowledges the catastrophic nature of the Mariel exodus, during which the Cuban government exploited circumstances to release prisoners and institutionalized individuals alongside those seeking refuge, he recognizes that the scale of immigration has evolved since then. Today, immigration remains a significant factor, with individuals from diverse backgrounds seeking new opportunities and a fresh start in the United States.


Julio's extraordinary life experiences have inspired him to not only tell his own story but also to shed light on the richness of Cuban culture. He passionately expresses his desire to document Cuba's traditions, jokes, and unique places that have yet to be explored in written form. "Cuba has such characteristic things that no one has written about," he says with enthusiasm.


Julio's journey serves as a reminder of the remarkable achievements and contributions of Cuban immigrants, not only in Miami but also in various fields worldwide. His unwavering dedication to education, his love for his homeland, and his commitment to leaving a lasting legacy make him an inspiration to all who aspire to overcome adversity and make a positive impact on the world.


Julio Gálvez's testimony is a testament to the resilience, determination, and unwavering pride of the Cuban people. His narrative illuminates the power of education and the ability of individuals to shape their destinies. As his autobiography takes shape, Julio's words will undoubtedly resonate with readers, offering insights into his personal journey and the broader experiences of the Cuban diaspora. His story is a powerful reminder of the enduring spirit that transcends borders and the deep connection one has to their homeland, no matter the distance.
