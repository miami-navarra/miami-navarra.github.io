Miami is no stranger to danger. Crime, drugs and natural threats such as hurricanes loom large over the city. However, locals have another enemy, who is much more discreet, but just as lethal. It bounces off the asphalt and weaves its way between the skyscrapers of Downtown. Some manage to avoid it, sheltered behind the glass of their air-conditioned offices, but others get hit right in the head. 
	
Dizziness, nausea, fainting. Blisters and peelings across tired arms and burned faces. Sometimes, even death. With every 10°F increase in temperature in Miami, another person passes away from a heat-related condition. The Miami-Dade Extreme Heat and Mortality Report calculated that each year, 301 emergency visits, 58 hospitalizations and 34 deaths were the work of the same assailant. Yet heat was cited as the primary cause in only two death certificates in the course of five years.

The phenomenon has been largely understudied by experts. Ludovica Martella, Heat Coordinator at the Miami-Dade County, finds a simple explanation for this: in Miami, unlike a tornado, a thunderstorm or a shooting, heat is the norm. People expect the city to be hot and see it as part of the environment. In fact, Martella points out that “people often say that they don’t think it has gotten any hotter than before, although the temperatures have risen through the years”. Plus, we are able to see how the sea rises and the clouds darken. Heat gets less attention because it is invisible. 

As invisible as it may be, it does make a certain number of victims every year. But who are they? A certain number of studies detail who is most vulnerable.

Deaths

In life, there are nuances. Although most victims counted in this study were men, science generally agrees that women are most vulnerable to heat-related deaths. “Generally, a woman’s body tends to sweat less than a man’s”, explains Martella. Studies also show that women start sweating later. These factors prevent their bodies from cooling properly. If a man and a woman are exposed to extreme heat at the same time, they will react differently on a biological level and one of them will suffer more. Studies show that this phenomenon hits older women the hardest. The elderly, young children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and athletes tend to also be on the radar.

Heat’s favorite prey remain outdoor workers, who are about 35% more vulnerable than regular citizens. Although the general data and studies still apply in their case, men workers are statistically more at risk than women workers. This could not only be explained by their superior number in the worker population, but also because they tend to be the ones to carry heavier things and risk to do the more dangerous tasks. But regardless of their gender, ethnicity or age, they all spend long hours over the burning sun. They build through Brickell and Downtown, where concrete streets and skyscrapers turn the city into an inferno. 

There are areas within a city that are warmer than others. Martella describes these places as full of construction sites and asphalt, no trees nor shade, sometimes lower income. The last point could also be related to climate justice: “usually, communities who suffer the most from climate change tend to be marginalized communities”, according to Martella. 

Miami-Dade County does have a list of particularly sensible areas: Homestead, Florida City, Hialeah, Opa-locka, Miami Gardens and, of course, City of Miami. Within the city itself, Brickell and Downtown are the highest in temperature, so they create an urban heat island effect. The more urbanized an area is, the stronger the heat gets. Sun rays are absorbed by asphalt, which releases that heat at night, making city centers often hotter than suburbs. So, depending on where you stand, you’ll feel heat differently. Surely you will notice a difference between a street full of traffic in Downtown and a park in Coconut Grove.

If there are differentiating factors, there are also solutions. Miami-Dade County is in the process of implementing several measures in order to beat the extreme heat and improve the lives of those who are more affected by it. That's why the Miami-Dade County Extreme Heat Action Plan was created, which is a program ran by the first Chief Heat Officer of the world, Jane Gilbert. Their purpose is to inform, prepare and protect people through several recommendations, initiatives and regulations. 

According to Gilbert, the plan is based on communication and aims to reach a big number of people to make them aware of the threats of heat and the adequate management of it. Many flyers and billboards are being distributed and posted in the areas of Miami that are most vulnerable to the heat. 

The plan is also carrying out short term strategies such as ensuring a stable AC system in the homes of the citizens and passing heat safe policies. Nevertheless, those are only useful to diminish the immediate effect of heat in people. 

Test

Another important measure taken by Miami’s administration and related to communication is The Extreme Heat Toolkit. It aims to have the policies and regulations that are being developed to beat extreme heat. 

Other initiatives are being implemented by the Government for those citizens who don’t have air conditioning or shelter and, thus, are very vulnerable to heat. Cooling centers are available in several places of the city in order to make them pass a less severe heat season. Related to this, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) was launched. It refers to a type of assistance that provides help to those households who have not enough income to afford heating or cooling systems. It is a national initiative that has a federal presence and, in the case of Florida, citizens can apply for assistance up to three times a year.

As another long-term solution, the planting of trees intends to purify the air of the environment, making it fresher and cooler. Trees have properties that mediate heat depending on their foliage; as Martella explains, “regular trees absorb more heat than for example palm trees”, quite ironically.

Map trees

One degree at a time, the planet is getting hotter. And brick by brick, workers build Miami, the sun reflecting off their fluorescent helmets. They risk their lives every day to allow the skyscrapers to emerge from the ground like mushrooms during the rainy season. The more they build, the hotter it gets. Who would have thought that sunshine and palm trees would have such morbid associations. But what if those palm trees were replaced by canopies? What if for every glass-walled building in Downtown, there was a Cooling Center, a refuge or a park? Alas, Miami keeps on growing upwards. This does not mean that there is no room for change.
