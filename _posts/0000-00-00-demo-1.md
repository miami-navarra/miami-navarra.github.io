Miami is no stranger to danger. Crime, drugs and natural threats such as hurricanes loom large over the city. However, locals have another enemy, who is much more discreet, but just as lethal. It bounces off the asphalt and weaves its way between the skyscrapers of Downtown. Some manage to avoid it, sheltered behind the glass of their air-conditioned offices, but others get hit right in the head. 
	
Dizziness, nausea, fainting. Blisters and peelings across tired arms and burned faces. Sometimes, even death. With every 10°F increase in temperature in Miami, another person passes away from a heat-related condition. The Miami-Dade Extreme Heat and Mortality Report calculated that each year, 301 emergency visits, 58 hospitalizations and 34 deaths were the work of the same assailant. Yet heat was cited as the primary cause in only two death certificates in the course of five years.



The phenomenon has been largely understudied by experts. Ludovica Martella, Heat Coordinator at the Miami-Dade County, finds a simple explanation for this: in Miami, unlike a tornado, a thunderstorm or a shooting, heat is the norm. People expect the city to be hot and see it as part of the environment. In fact, Martella points out that “people often say that they don’t think it has gotten any hotter than before, although the temperatures have risen through the years”. Plus, we are able to see how the sea rises and the clouds darken. Heat gets less attention because it is invisible. 

As invisible as it may be, it does make a certain number of victims every year. But who are they? A certain number of studies detail who is most vulnerable.
