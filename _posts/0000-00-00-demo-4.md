lede: The Haitian heart, 1108km from its origins, establishes new roots in North American culture. The need for a sense of home becomes a constant in the face of the remoteness of the country that formed them. All that remains is to cling to the land, to their loved ones, and to themselves, and who is one without their culture?

## About Gentrification
Miami is a global city with tremendous opportunities, but also with numerous challenges to be addressed. Among them is one with significant impact: the phenomenon of gentrification. Simply put, the ever-increasing rent in specific areas, which forces residents who do not have property in their name, to leave the neighborhood when they truly do not want to move out of their communities.

To discuss the topic of gentrification, we will start with the well-known example of Wynwood. With a great history behind it before the Puerto Ricans, Little San Juan was transformed by numerous ambitious projects that promised to change the area, and, as a result, Wynwood is now nothing less than a tourist site that has displaced local history. 

Just as the phenomenon of gentrification has led to the disappearance of Little San Juan, immigrant communities in Little Havana and Little Haiti are concerned not only about the displacement of their families, but also the fragmentation it means for their communities and their local stores.

Arnold, Louis and Merlin, are some of the countless cases that are affected by the events. Some have lived in Little Haiti for more than seven years, or others still have family living in the area. However, the growing cost of rent is increasing as well as their worries that, at the pace they are going, they will reach their expiration date, forcing them to move.

Merlin, who has been living in Little Haiti for more than 10 years, mentions that the situation is very complicated, as they have been part of this territory for a long time and suddenly they want to kick them out to get their place: "It is not right. You have to give people the chance to live, you know? (...) they just want to push you out. It is not fair". And he continues with: "The price is so high, almost doubled that nobody wants to stay". 

Here we can see the comparison between the rent prices before and after 2015 summer. Although neither the price nor the increase seems much, it is important to understand that it is the area with the lowest household incomes in all of Miami.

Since 2017, no area in Miami- Dade county has increased its rental price more than Little Haiti, in 2 years there is a flat increase of 300$ per month, as we can see in the graph showing the rent prices after 2017 summer.

Continuing with this data we see the decrease of people who are spending 30% of the household income in rent. We see an acceleration after the pandemic years, mainly because a lot of people lost their jobs, added to the increased demand for housing in the area during those years resulting in a lot of people having to move away or losing their house due to not being able to pay.

This situation has led to the construction of a 1.36$ billion Magic City Innovation District 
development in Little Haiti. This will be a 1.7 thousand square kilometers structure. There is growing concern about the potential negative environmental and social impacts of the project, including economic displacement of residents who have historically resided and worked in Little Haiti, the majority of whom are low-income families of color. Without taking the time to establish a complete picture of the project’s environmental and social costs and benefits, Magic City Innovation District runs the risk of perpetuating economic and racial inequities across Miami communities and contributing to unsustainable development practices that threaten Miami’s long-term resilience.

The construction of Magic City, despite the clear and negative opposition exercised by the inhabitants of Little Haiti, demonstrates the lack of preoucpacion of the construction companies and governments in the face of the multiple environmental, social and economic problems that this area has suffered for years. "They're turning Little Haiti into Wynwood." It is the statement of Sonny, a man who has lived in this neighborhood for more than 40 years and has lived through all the events and consequences that have led to the construction of this gigantic touristic complex.

Gentrification is a problem to be fought, economic segregation in Miami continues to increase and the incongruities between planes and reality are insabable. Trying to build a complex of such dimensions in a neighborhood mostly workers and rented immigrants, who suffer to pay their rent, shows a complete disconnection between governments and construction companies of reality.



### “In Miami, everyone is from everywhere”

(1) “After sometime working for someone, I want to become my own boss”

(2) “What is happening now is that Miami is becoming so vast and expensive”

(3) “When I arrived, it was a cultural shock”

Fritz was born in Haiti and left his country in the ambition of exploring and discovering the US. By connecting with the community of Little Haiti, he started to feel inside that so-called “melting pot” Miami is often named. He graduated from Business and Administration and wanted to work as a health insurance agent. Formed a small family and has one son and one daughter. However, the situation in Miami has changed and the whole community has sensed it. But his plans of developing his most desired dream have not varied and confronts these events in the best way he can.

###### What's your story regarding migration?

I left my country at 17 years old and my country was having some trouble. It wasn't my idea, someone told me this country is going through this situation and since everyone was leaving and exploring I ended up coming here. I was under my parents roof and, when I arrived, it was a cultural shock. I didn't know anybody, I really didn't know what to expect, growing up I was familiar with everything around me and now i´m not there anymore, you know nothing about this place. Eventually I developed the sense to know what to do, where to go. Starting from going to school and learning the  language, once you are able to communicate everything turns out to be much easier. You start to find out about the country and the culture. After learning the language I started to look for jobs and really understand the country and its culture. And I found out, especially here in Miami, everyone is from everywhere, especially because of the sun and the warm temperature in Florida. Thanks to this the culture in Miami it's really dynamic. I find myself here because if I were to be in any other part of the US, it would be all Americans and I would feel unwelcomed. In this sense New York is like Miami, everyone is from everywhere.

When you arrive you look for the people you know, that's why in the South of Florida you find people that only speak Spanish, jobs and schools are all in Spanish because they’ve created their own community there and it is the same here with little Haiti. The businesses are run by Haitian people who speak Creole. We all have evolved a lot, know the language and, specially, we are now professionals. I have a license, we all learn, we have a lot of engineers, nurses. You know, we come here to work. To the point Little Haiti has its own magistrate, city council and chamber, and it's all Haitians and along them we try to be a community where anyone feels welcomed and comfortable to live in.

###### Do you think they are trying to make this place more urban?

Eventually yes. What is happening now is that Miami is becoming so vast and expensive, like what happened in California, so a lot of people are moving out because they can't afford it. When I came you could buy a house for 200,000$ and after the pandemic you needed at least 400,000$. Florida was more flexible during the pandemic and the weather is better, so a lot of people from places like New York started living here, this made the pricing to be higher. Not counting the immigrants from the Caribe or South and Central America that also need a place to live.

How did you end up in this job?

Well, after I graduated college, Business and Administration, I decided I needed a license. My intent is to have my own business, and with this license I’m able to get it started. I had to do a test to get the license and sell insurance to the public. Now I can definitely manage a business with that license. I opened my own shop, I signed up with companies like Florida Blue to sell their own insurance. But I get benefits from that. The idea is that after sometime working for someone, I wanna become my own boss. I really didn't have everything, but eventually I learned the system, I went to school here, I learned the culture. Now it's time for me to establish myself, accumulate wealth and, when I’m stable enough, I want to finally start my own business.

And what kind of business are you thinking of?

I’m thinking of a company to sell my insurance. Or I might open my own restaurant. I learned Business and Administration, so I can administer my business. Even if I open a restaurant, I have the requirements and knowledge to run it. The only thing left needed is the capital. Either you get the capital or you go to a bank and get a loan. But once I get there I will make my business run at full scale.

Are you living here with your family?

Not with my parents, I left them back in our country. But I did file for them to come here. And they come and go, you know? They prefer over there. When they come here, they don’t know the language, they don’t know the country. They sit at the house and they feel bored. They would rather be in their country.

Could you tell us a story of someone that has been placed out from here because of the rent price?

It happened to me. I owned a house and I sold it. It was a 3 bedroom and 2 bathroom house with garage and everything. I sold it for 100,000$ around 12 years ago. Now the same house, if I were to buy it, would cost 400,000$. I moved to an apartment, but I once bought a piece of land for 30,000$ with the money I got. I’m not thinking of renting a house here because I don’t want a 200,000$ or 250,000$ mortgage. That is way too much, half of my salary will go on rent. I mean, I could afford it, but I would rather keep it low because you never know what could happen. At some point, things that go up fall down.

Do you think climate gentrification has something to do with all this?

Yes, I think that is why they are amplifying this climate change agenda lately. Now building a house is more efficient, they don’t use oil and make that smoke. A lot of things got modified. The air has also changed, it doesn’t feel that hot, you know?
