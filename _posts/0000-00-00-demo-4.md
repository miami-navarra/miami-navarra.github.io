Miami is a global city with tremendous opportunities, but also with numerous challenges to be addressed. Among them is one with significant impact: the phenomenon of gentrification. Simply put, the ever-increasing rent in specific areas, which forces residents who do not have property in their name, to leave the neighborhood when they truly do not want to move out of their communities.

## About Gentrification

To discuss the topic of gentrification, we will start with the well-known example of Wynwood. With a great history behind it before the Puerto Ricans, Little San Juan was transformed by numerous ambitious projects that promised to change the area, and, as a result, Wynwood is now nothing less than a tourist site that has displaced local history. 

Just as the phenomenon of gentrification has led to the disappearance of Little San Juan, immigrant communities in Little Havana and Little Haiti are concerned not only about the displacement of their families, but also the fragmentation it means for their communities and their local stores.

Arnold, Louis and Merlin, are some of the countless cases that are affected by the events. Some have lived in Little Haiti for more than seven years, or others still have family living in the area. However, the growing cost of rent is increasing as well as their worries that, at the pace they are going, they will reach their expiration date, forcing them to move.

Merlin, who has been living in Little Haiti for more than 10 years, mentions that the situation is very complicated, as they have been part of this territory for a long time and suddenly they want to kick them out to get their place: "It is not right. You have to give people the chance to live, you know? (...) they just want to push you out. It is not fair". And he continues with: "The price is so high, almost doubled that nobody wants to stay". 

Here we can see the comparison between the rent prices before and after 2015 summer. Although neither the price nor the increase seems much, it is important to understand that it is the area with the lowest household incomes in all of Miami.

Since 2017, no area in Miami- Dade county has increased its rental price more than Little Haiti, in 2 years there is a flat increase of 300$ per month, as we can see in the graph showing the rent prices after 2017 summer.

Continuing with this data we see the decrease of people who are spending 30% of the household income in rent. We see an acceleration after the pandemic years, mainly because a lot of people lost their jobs, added to the increased demand for housing in the area during those years resulting in a lot of people having to move away or losing their house due to not being able to pay.

This situation has led to the construction of a 1.36$ billion Magic City Innovation District 
development in Little Haiti. This will be a 1.7 thousand square kilometers structure. There is growing concern about the potential negative environmental and social impacts of the project, including economic displacement of residents who have historically resided and worked in Little Haiti, the majority of whom are low-income families of color. Without taking the time to establish a complete picture of the project’s environmental and social costs and benefits, Magic City Innovation District runs the risk of perpetuating economic and racial inequities across Miami communities and contributing to unsustainable development practices that threaten Miami’s long-term resilience.

The construction of Magic City, despite the clear and negative opposition exercised by the inhabitants of Little Haiti, demonstrates the lack of preoucpacion of the construction companies and governments in the face of the multiple environmental, social and economic problems that this area has suffered for years. "They're turning Little Haiti into Wynwood." It is the statement of Sonny, a man who has lived in this neighborhood for more than 40 years and has lived through all the events and consequences that have led to the construction of this gigantic touristic complex. 

Gentrification is a problem to be fought, economic segregation in Miami continues to increase and the incongruities between planes and reality are insabable. Trying to build a complex of such dimensions in a neighborhood mostly workers and rented immigrants, who suffer to pay their rent, shows a complete disconnection between governments and construction companies of reality.
