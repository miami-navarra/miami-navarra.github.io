Miami is seen by many as the “Gateway to America” and Little Havana is one of the places where Cubans and Latinamericans settle with the hope for a better life. This has become a friendly and colorful neighborhood, where tourists can experience Cuban culture, but it is also a place where members of the community rather enjoy their privacy away from the cameras.

## H2 The vibrant neighborhood where Latino cultures mix ##
As soon as you drive in, the music surrounds you as people play live music in the restaurants with congas, pianoes and singers who interpret tipical latin songs. The colorful murals are everywhere, with hidden meaning that a few understand and only expert eyes may find. Little Havana is a vibrant neighborhood that has been growing for the past years, and has now become one of the most touristic places in Miami. Why? Because it is the perfect place to experience the Latin American culture in this city. 

Calle 8 is the colorful main street of this neighborhood, where locals and tourists mix together. Because of this all kinds of stores co-exist in the streets, such as local supermarkets, barber shops and hair salons.While the neighborhood has experienced changes, it still retains its essence as a haven for Cuban heritage and traditions. The iconic Calle Ocho, with its domino parks, Latin music venues, and art galleries, remains a vibrant symbol of Little Havana's Cuban roots. The blend of old and new creates a unique and dynamic atmosphere, where tradition and innovation coexist harmoniously.

The neighborhood is home to restaurants from many nationalities, such as Mexican, Spanish, Cuban and more, where visitors can try the different dishes of each country. But, the street also has restaurants from recognized chains, like Starbucks, Subway, Domino’s Pizza, and McDonalds, whose outside walls are covered with murals to fit perfectly with the atmosphere of Calle 8.

While walking down the streets, the palm trees create a refreshing shade from the heat that is typical of Miami. In order to hide from the sun, by strolling Calle 8 visitors enter one of the many restaurants or bars, or maybe the famous ice-cream shop Azúcar.
