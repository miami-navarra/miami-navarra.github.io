This has become a friendly and colorful neighborhood, where tourists can experience Cuban culture, but it is also a place where members of the community rather enjoy their privacy away from the cameras.

Many wonder why Azúcar is everywhere in the community. This is an iconic phrase of the famous singer Celia Cruz and said word may be found in many places around Little Havana, if one knows where to look.

### _Jesús’ long life in Little Havana_ ###
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6">
   At first, Jesús may appear shy, speaking only a few words with a thick Cuban accent that has not disappeared after so many years in Miami. He does not speak much English, as he learned on the streets that he speaks an “inglés machucao.” Even nowadays, he still does not speak much English. However, Jesús is all smiles and cares about others, even if he doesn’t need to, but does it out of the kindness of his heart. 
    Jesús overcame the biggest challenge, becoming an immigrant, and moved from Cuba to the US. The 80-year-old came to Miami in the 80s in one of the many waves of Cubans that entered the country during those years. After his wife came to Miami, he decided to follow her with a shared dream: a new future.  Jesús had an advantage not all immigrants had in the first waves of  Cuban migration, a helping hand and support from his family. Before he came to Miami, his in-laws already lived here and helped him settle. Currently, he has lived in Miami for more than 40 years and has seen the growth of Little Havana.

This man has not let his age define him, as he still works all day in the neighborhood to support his family. This being said, Jesús has made a coconut stand out of a bicycle. For the last decade, he drives around Little Havana and settles in different places of Calle 8 to sell fresh coconuts to tourists that walk by .But, he doesn’t let the heat defeat him. With his typical Cuban straw hat called Canotier, he stands beside his bicycle selling coconuts and sometimes flowers with a smile on his face. 

His life has not been easy. After retiring, Jesus still needed to work to provide for his family, which motivated him to open his coconut stand in Little Havana more than ten years ago. Jesús has seen the neighborhood grow throughout the years. Little Havana had nothing when he started, and Calle 8 was only another street in Miami. 

On the other hand, the people that come to Little Havana have also changed. Jesus has seen how the Cuban neighborhood he once knew has become a place where Latin American people from different nationalities come to live and work. Currently, tourists and locals do not only listen to thick Cuban accents on the streets, but many more are present. With the Latino community growing and diversifying itself every day, Jesus and his coconut stand amid the growth and development of Little Havana.
