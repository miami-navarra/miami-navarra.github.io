Miami is seen by many as the “Gateway to America” and Little Havana is one of the places where Cubans and Latinamericans settle with the hope for a better life. This has become a friendly and colorful neighborhood, where tourists can experience Cuban culture, but it is also a place where members of the community rather enjoy their privacy away from the cameras.
