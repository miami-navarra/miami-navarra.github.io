Miami's culinary landscape is a testament to its diversity and the rich tapestry of cultures that call this city home. From traditional dishes to contemporary fusion, the stories shared throughout the next three chapters take you on a flavorful journey around an ever-flowing, ever-transforming city.

The world is never as big as it seems. From nine different countries, all the members and protagonists of this project have ended up in the same place: Miami.

# Happening

Food has always been a powerful expression of tradition and culture. In one of Miami’s most visited streets, Calle Ocho – at the heart of Miami's Cuban community – various local restaurants balance themselves between authenticity and performative appeal, catering to both local customers and passing tourists.

This chapter explores two notable establishments: The Latino supermarket El Nuevo Siglo which is vastly popular among the local community, and Old's Havana, a restaurant that has transformed into a tourist hotspot while retaining the tradition and flavors of Cuban food.

There is no doubt that Little Havana has become the heart of Cuban culture in Miami, with thousands of tourists visiting the famous “Calle Ocho” every year. The walk through the street is full with different restaurants that include live music and the opportunity to try Cuban food. This aspect has made many wonder if Little Havana has lost its authenticity and become purely a performance street made for tourists. However, there are still restaurants that try to maintain the Cuban essence, places filled with locals. 

That is the case of El Nuevo Siglo Supermarket, a little store that has a market and a restaurant in the same place. His founder, Pedro Jaime, also known as Paco, is a Cuban immigrant who moved to Miami in 1996 and opened the shop in 1999. 

The beginnings of the store were not easy, and Paco, together with his co-owner Octavio Gallardo, a Colombian immigrant, had it difficult to see El Nuevo Siglo evolve towards what it is nowadays. As Paco explains it, they started with a small business, which today is a bigger one that has between 30 and 40 workers. It has become a place where locals are able to eat food that reminds them of their homeland, Latin America.

However, it is not just locals who are attracted to this experience. Paco explains how tourists are also attracted to his store and how when they get back to their countries they post a recommendation post on different platforms.

But, what is it that makes El Nuevo Siglo so attractive? Paco states that it is the traditional Cuban way in which they make the food and the special characteristic the restaurant has: the food is cooked in front of the clients. This allows the customers to see exactly what they are eating and to establish a conversation and a connection with the cooks. The meals are made using traditional Cuban recipes, seasonings and passion and have not been changed in order to adapt to the American culture. In a street as touristic as Little Havana, this is appreciated by tourists and locals, who have gone back throughout the years.

“Our food defends a lot what home food is, the flavors that we remember from when we arrived home from work, from school, the food from our grandmothers and mothers”, that is how Manuel Alejandro, manager of the restaurant Old's Havana, describes the food served at the local. This restaurant, located on the heart of Calle 8 in Little Havana, transports its customers to the Cuban atmosphere of the 1940s and 1950s with the use of music and performances.

## Crossroads

In a city as culturally diverse as Miami, it’s not rare to find a variety of fusion restaurants that come together to create new flavors. This chapter explores how chefs who prioritize the preservation of their culture and authentic recipes, embed themselves into an ever-changing environment.

On the sunny streets of South Beach Miami, hidden on a corner to the right, the smell of fresh pizza dough, tomato sauce and basil sneaks between the hot humid air. If you sniff around, it will lead you right to it. A place that feels, looks and smells like a fantasy: La Leggenda. Giovanni Gagliardi, the owner and main chef, was born in San Felipe a Cancello, a small town about 23 kilometers from Napoli. Since he was a little boy he has been making pizza, his family owned a traditional pizzeria in Napoli, throughout the years he worked to become what he is today: a legend. He opened La Leggenda in 2017 and it became an immediate success. It attracts people from all around the world and has won prizes such as "Best Pizza of Miami” by the New Times newspaper. Everyday there is a new masterpiece in his pizzeria, creativity and quality are his main focus in the kitchen. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952134299?h=9154c53dcb&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="02-melania"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

It only took one visit for Melania to become a frequent customer in La Leggenda: “I can’t believe it’s been five years since I first listened to that Napolitalian music that drew me inside the pizzeria”. Meliania was touristing when she stumbled upon it on her way to the beach, she ended up moving to Miami. Now, she eats here almost every day. Her favorite pizza, La Capricciosa, immediately transports her home.

Although it's known for its savory mixture of Caribbean, South, and Central American tastes, the city of Miami also has other, perhaps more subtle, flavors in its mix. Many immigrants in Miami use food as a way to hold on to their cultures, and the Korean culinary scene in the city is no exception. “Where there’s good Korean food, there’s also a Korean community,” writes Minhae Shim Roth, a Korean-American arts and culture writer for the Miami New Times. 

With her small business, Market Seoul, Chef Jihyeon Lee is working to bring a little bit of South Korea to Miami in order to build that community. With her cooking classes, meal kits, and traditional recipes, not only is she helping to make home seem less far away for Korean immigrants, but also to introduce new flavors and ingredients to other locals and tourists passing through the 305.

## Metamorphosis

The final chapter explores the impact of culture on Miami’s cuisine. With insights from Nate Coffey, the 19-year-old owner of Cafe Mezzanotte, and Carlos Frías, the former food editor for the Miami Herald, we will explore how Miami's food scene is beginning to flourish and fuse diverse culinary traditions.

  <p>Carlos Frías has a longstanding trajectory as the former food editor for the Miami Herald and as a renowned radio host. He holds a deep understanding of how food and culture have evolved in Miami over the years, and his multicultural upbringing has given him unique insights into the city's diverse culinary landscape.</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> How was culture and food present in your previous jobs?</p>

  <p><strong>Carlos Frías:</strong> I wrote about food and I also had a podcast that I did with a colleague of mine, Amy Reyes, which was mostly about culture. So from beyond my need, the culture through food expanded. My job was hyper local and mainly about getting to know people who are adding to Miami culture. We had conversations with chefs as part of that as well. So a little bit of everything; we really tried to represent culture.</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> As a person with a multicultural background, how do you see yourself in a multicultural Miami?</p>

  <p><strong>Frias:</strong> I try to think about Miami's culture, and how it is influenced by the culture of different places, rather than focusing on my Cuban ancestry. I try to think about how, when those people arrive here, does that influence the culture of this place, right? Because Miami itself has a strong identity, I try to think about that about Miami culture, when people come from other places, they come from New York and San Francisco, they affect the culture too. So it's important to think about it as a place that is not set.</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> So you see Miami like a crossroad, no?</p>

  <p><strong>Frías:</strong> Absolutely. Ever-changing and ever-evolving, little buildings at the edge of the crossroads getting knocked down and built, built again.</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> Do you think that people feel those places as theirs?</p>

  <p><strong>Frías:</strong> That performative side of food helps people identify themselves within the many cultures present in Miami. There's a little shop that makes a mofongo with pastrami brisket, and one of the owners is Puerto Rican, and her husband is Venezuelan, but they came together. And so they created this dish that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The dish itself is performative. It's saying, "We are Puerto Rican, but we are also a barbecue place, and it's Miami barbecue."</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> What has Miami to offer?</p>

  <p><strong>Frías:</strong> It's not just what we know about Miami as the side of the glitz and glam and the side of immigration. Because that's mostly what we have been taught, what that's the idea that most people have, but now what does Miami have to offer? Is it something new? Is it better? Is it just different? I don't know.</p>

  <p>Miami is a world-class city and you couldn't say that 20 years ago. That means if I think of a cuisine, I can find it in Miami. I can find Ethiopian food, I can find Nigerian food, I can find Korean food, Vietnamese, Laotian food... You can find any kind of cuisine in Miami and that's not something you could say two decades ago.</p>

  <p><strong>Q.</strong> How do you want to reflect Miami’s culture from now on? </p>

  <p><strong>Frías:</strong> I'm not sure what's next, but I know that this kind of storytelling about Miami is what I want to do. I think that it will be something that tries to give voice to people in Miami. I think it'll be something like that, whether it's an audio or video or written… We'll see what's next.</p>
