Who is truly behind the wheel when public transport fails?

Uber, a rideshare brand, first arrived in Miami in 2014 as a competitor to the popular yellow taxi cabs. Ten years later and taxis no longer have the upper hand in the city. Uber’s main focus is all about meeting the needs of both drivers and passengers. Nowadays the company doesn't just provide a way for people to get from point A to point B. 

It's also a reliable source of income for drivers, who, in Miami, are often migrants. The company's website says it supports immigrants and partners with non-profits. It also offers a flexible work schedule, which makes it easier for drivers to stay in this type of job.

Orlando, Jorge, Ernesto and Carlos are just a few of the thousands of drivers who navigate Miami streets for a paycheck. They all have their own stories, from Carlos fleeing Venezuela to Orlando raising a family away from his home in Cuba.

Despite their different backgrounds, they're all looking for the same thing — a way to make a living. But not everyone is doing it the same way. 

We found that drivers see this job in three different ways: as a full-time job, as a part-time job, and as a way to make money on the side.

## Full-time: Jorge

Jorge is an example of a driver that determines his job in Uber as his only source of income.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952134359?h=86232930da&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="03-jorge_final"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

He receives approximately $200 a day – although this depends on the size of the vehicle, time of the year and, sometimes, even the weather. He was the kind of man who tried to include our colleague that did not speak any Spanish into the conversation.

Jorge explained his fate of having to leave Venezuela with the solemnity of a grandma throwing away the old toys of her grown up children. He had already visited Miami previously a few times. He is originally from Portugal.


## Part-time: Carlos &amp; Ernesto

There are other drivers who choose not to entirely rely on the company to pay their bills, taking advantage of the flexibility Uber allows its employees and combining their hours on the road with their jobs in other companies. Carlos and Ernesto are two of those drivers. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952134332?h=ccf2020fcc&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="03-carlos_final"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952160390?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="01-ernesto_final"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>


Carlos left his house, his car and his sister in Venezuela, coming to Miami for a short vacation. His days in Miami started to exceed this vacation so he decided to stay, hoping to visit his home country again, but not planning to return. 

Different is the case of Ernesto, a 25-year-old Cuban who came to Miami looking for job opportunities.


## “Whenever I want”: Orlando

Orlando told us that whenever he showed his name to the children he taught in Spain, they all remembered him by this famous fried tomato brand called Orlando. With the same comic tone, he started to introduce us to his life as a retired home health care service employer that decided to use Uber in his spare time. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952134402?h=5cbd3ca7f9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="03-orlando_final"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Driving across the palace he married into and the churches where he baptized his daughters, Orlando told us all that was needed to know about Miami streets and buildings. In Cuba he had a big library, he said, one which he shared with his grandfather. Now he's been in Miami for 37 years and he persists to continue driving and reading.

## Connecting Miami

When people get in a cab they only see the back of the driver’s seat. Orlando, Ernesto, Jorge and Carlos told us just in the first seconds of a ride they know when a passenger wants to talk or not. People look at their phones, take time to think about the day or call someone they love during those rides. 

What we have learned is that just by a simple gesture you can get closer to realities that are hundreds of kilometers away. That is how we got to learn about the wonderful island of Cuba, the grass from Venezuela, or the landscape of Portugal. 

Engineers, doctors and health professionals are the ones covering the mobility issues in Miami, which should be the responsibility of the State. They are not just drivers, careers or jobs. They are people with stories that await for someone curious enough to ask about them.

## More: Arriving: Never

Miami's under-developed public transportation system allows rideshare services like Uber and Lyft to thrive. Getting from place to place is a struggle for locals and tourists alike — [options are limited and unreliable](/arriving-never), heavy urban traffic leads to gridlocks and accidents, and "rush hour" seems infinite.
