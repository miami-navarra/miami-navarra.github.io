If one looks closely at the history of Miami, it becomes clear that one thing is certain: looking at the history of Miami also means looking at the history of racial segregation.

It was between 1894 and 1895 that the lands of South Florida began to attract those who, also seeking warmer lands, fled from ruined crops to settle in a new, friendlier territory. These new and better lands were named the City of Miami in 1986, as scholar Marvin Dunn of Florida International University documented.

Telling the history of Miami is impossible without talking about the history of the Black population in South Florida. As Dunn explains, when Miami was seeking city status, they sought the help of the Black population, originally established in a designated area known as Colored Town.  

The Black population designated to inhabit Colored Town represented up to one-third of the new residents in the area. Without them, it was impossible to grant city status to the new lands offering a better climate and quality of life. It was then, for a brief moment in history, that the Black population was granted the vote for the purpose of officially making these lands a city.

Perhaps it is not so surprising, then, that the first name to appear on the city's charter belonged to one of the suburban residents: Silas Austin. And, paradoxically, it is also not a surprise that, after casting their votes, the Black population was once again excluded and degraded in their status as citizens.

This was not the only time the Black community was given the right to vote only for it to be taken back right away. Three years after the city charter was signed in Miami, the white inhabitants wanted the county seat to be moved from Juno to Miami, needing the Black votes again to reach their goal.

This dynamic was not limited to using the Black population as a bargaining chip for the interests of the white population, but, as something considered natural at the time, it extended to all aspects of daily life. 

While white business communities expanded rapidly from 1896 through 1926, on the other side of the railroad tracks, the buildings in Colored Town were made of wood and in dangerous conditions. They seemed to be a century behind. 

In addition, regardless of the black folk amounting to almost all of the physical laborers used to build the city, no black person could operate a business outside Colored Town. Also, they were not allowed to operate a business that catered to white people, although white merchants could operate freely in Colored Town. The basic city services in Colored Town were scarce, the streets unpaved, and the houses in deteriorating condition. These resulted in many challenges in the community, fires, lack of adequate sanitation facilities, and an inability to improve their situation. 

## A ray of hope 

Even in these oppressive business conditions, some black people succeeded. For example, D.A. Dorsey is known for being the city’s first black millionaire. When he arrived in Miami, he noticed there was a vital need for housing in Colored Town, so he had the idea of building small single-family homes on land he purchased, renting them to newly arrived Black folks who were in desperate need of housing. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952137607?h=e729b9b1a7&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="04-history"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

With the income from renting his properties, he acquired money to build new houses and a hotel, building his own home at 250 Northwest Ninth Street in 1913, still preserved to this day by the Black Archives.

By the 1900s, Overtown had grown into a vibrant community. There were many successful Black business owners, to name a few, R.A. Powers, a furniture salesman, or D.D. Cail, who rented houses, operated a restaurant, and owned a packing house on Dixie Highway. Black communities from all over Miami, namely Coconut Grove and Lemon City, would travel to Colored Town for shopping, business transactions, and their booming entertainment industry.  

There are many more names on this list, like the founder of The Lyric Theater, Geder Walker. The Lyric opened in 1913 and quickly became the major center of entertainment for Black people in Miami. On October 16, 1915, the Miami Metropolis described it as, “possibly the most beautiful and costly playhouse owned by colored people in all the Southland”. It is the lone surviving building in the district known as “Little Broadway”, still in use to this day by the Black Archives.

From the 1930s through to the 1950s, Colored Town was in its Heyday. The streets were bustling with music, lavish cars, perfumed men and women wearing stylish clothing, and frequented the clubs and restaurants along the Avenue. Many white folks crossed the railroad tracks to frequent the night spots of Colored Town. At its peak, a few Black business owners became very wealthy. Make no mistake, throughout all of this prosperity, the Ku Klux Klan was going rampant. 

However, nothing lasts forever. By the 1950s, a large portion of the middle-income Black community had moved North from Overtown to the new developments. In the mid-1960s, Overtown began to lose its luster. 

When the extension of downtown Miami led to the Interstate 95 expressway, which was completed in the mid-1960s, it ripped through the center of Overtown, wiping out excessive housing as well as the Black business district. The population of Overtown before the interstate was around 40 thousand and less than 8,000 have left by the mid-1990s.

All these displaced people faced, as today, policies that instead of helping them, closed doors and denied opportunities. The strategy promoted by The National Housing promised improvements in living conditions but systematically denied access to these opportunities. This is known as redlining, where basic health, economic, and service provisions are systematically denied to populations based on income and, primarily, race. Thus, segregation in Miami suddenly took on a new form.

## Climate, money define the new town 

Climate gentrification will displace one million people in Miami alone. 

According to the Frontiers in Climate Organization’s definition, "climate gentrification refers to the ways that climate impacts may contribute to changes in community characteristics and potential displacement of vulnerable residents through changes in property values."

Who could have imagined this 80 years ago when the National Housing Act was approved? Without a doubt, the world, and especially Miami, has entered a new reality and a new era that is impacting the most vulnerable.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/18165064"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Historically, Miami was a segregated city, this would mean a clear and tangible separation between Black and white neighborhoods. Until the mid-60s and the murder of Martin Luther King, Black people were required to present a temporary ID to enter white-considered neighborhoods to work and earn a way of living. 

The segregation, especially because of the creation of Redlining materialized color-coded maps by the Home Owners Loan Corporation, the neighborhoods of the United States and, in this case, Miami, were created. The maps would follow four colors that would represent the four social groups represented in society. Being green the best and red the worst. Nobody, and especially, from the green, desired to live in red-lined considered neighborhoods. However, that was then, because now things have changed, and all because of climate change. 

The floods, fires, and other natural catastrophes that affect Miami, have obliged the residents of the historical green areas to displace themselves to neighborhoods like Overtown. Consequently, this has had negative repercussions on the citizens who have lived in those areas for a long time. Not to mention, the radical and spontaneous increase in the price of living in Overtown, nowadays, houses in Overtown almost reach $500,000 dollars. Something unthinkable and unreachable for the vast majority of the citizens in Overtown, one of the neighborhoods best positioned to combat sea level rise. This increase in the sea level rise, would result in the uninhibitedness of the buildings that are located  near the coast. 

This has forced residents who have lived in these neighborhoods for such a long time, to move to areas that are more economically accessible. In other words, they have had to leave their homes. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/18175980"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

According to the  Overtown's Environmental Impact Statement, written in 1982, the U.S government knew the conditions of air quality, noise levels that would come with redeveloping the area for the rich migrators, and all the negative effects the residents of Overtown would face. They would live near continuous construction and the main roads, producing harmful effects in the families living there, such as asthma, cancer or heart conditions. 

## Is redline a lifeline? 

Past segregation is a key determinant of quality of life in present-day neighborhoods. According to the study The Effects of Historical Housing Policies on Resident Exposure to Intra-Urban Heat, published by the Health World Organization, the increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in a heightened state of precarity. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952137565?h=5e28bf679e&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="04-gentrification"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Recent analysis proved that redlining supported racialized access to healthy environments. In other words, Black people were required to present an ID to have access to services. Also, redlining destinations are usually associated with lack of green spaces and tree canopy, urban heat exposure, and health conditions such as asthma, cancer, and adverse birth outcomes. 

On top of that, asthma occurs at a higher frequency and with more severe diseases in people of African ancestry, as proved by scientific research from the University of Chicago. Also, Schuyler and Wenzel’s research demonstrates grade D neighborhoods suffered from carbon monoxide, sulfur, and volatile organic emissions. These poor air quality and poorly controlled asthma disproportionately burden Black people. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/18165868"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Their research results proved that the worst asthma-related outcomes and inadequate delivery of asthma care occurred among participants from grade D neighborhoods: besides that, the lack of trees means there is less filtering of air pollutants that worsen this community's health. 

Further research conducted by Swope, D-graded areas had 16.21% less tree canopy coverage than A on average in 2011. The figure below compares Overtown, a formally D-graded area, and Coral Gables, which is made up of mostly A-graded and B-graded areas. 

## Redlining beyond the public services

In the case of Overtown, there are county documents that prove the air pollution conditions are high. In the Final Environmental Impact State of the Overtown Station Area Redevelopment, from 1982, it is recognized that the primary source of air pollution is from vehicular traffic, mostly from the I-95 expressway and construction activities.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/952139271?h=5d17edaeb5&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="04-redlining"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The paper also recognized that the redevelopment’s construction activities would result in displacements, noise, and air pollution, and impede the circulation and safety/security of the residents. 

Also, steadily increasing warming trends due to global warming are intensifying already higher temperatures in heat island areas. Heat islands are described by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 2014 as urban areas where structures such as buildings, roads, and other infrastructure which absorb and re-emit the sun's heat are highly concentrated and greenery is limited. The research by Scotland revealed that urban heat islands in the United States have resulted in part from the effects of redlining. 

Urban heat islands are associated with increased energy consumption and air pollution, worsening water quality, and health risks. These are all things that Black communities are already predisposed to due to past segregation. Furthermore, a recent nationwide study indicates that African Americans have the highest surface heat island intensity exposure compared to the White population.

Additionally, African Americans are at greater risk of heat-related mortality than other racial groups. There is a link between the rise in the prevalence of kidney stones and the increased temperatures in neighborhoods affected by redlining. Additionally, the research by Jackson states that compared to White Americans, African Americans are 40% more likely to have hypertension, experience twice the incidence of stroke, and develop kidney disease at a rate four times greater. 

African Americans also suffer from higher rates of diabetes. This higher prevalence of heat-related morbidity among African Americans is not due to genetic differences, but rather disparities in health and living conditions, such as residing on a heat island.
