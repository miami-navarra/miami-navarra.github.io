**PART 1: La Casa de los Trucos History**

La Casa de los Trucos, literally translated to House of Tricks, appears as an ordinary costume store nestled between 14th and 13th SW Avenue on Eighth Street – except that it is one of the oldest Cuban-owned businesses in Little Havana. Established in 1972 by Esteban Torres, La Casa de los Trucos mirrors the original enterprise in Old Havana, Cuba. The first La Casa de los Trucos existed in Cuba since the 1910s.

According to Jorge Torres, the son of Esteban Torres and current manager of La Casa de los Trucos in today’s Calle Ocho, the first iteration of the store in Miami was a wooden structure that would tremble from the scared jumps of surprise inside. 

 Jorge’s father, Esteban Torres, was fascinated by La Casa de los Trucos when he was a kid in Habana La Vieja and, according to Jorge, “He liked it, [so he thought] ‘Hey, why not open it up here?’”

Jorge showed us taped photos on the walls that featured well-known Miami celebrities like Andy Garcia and Gloria Estefan visiting the costume store. As he played a video of Gloria Estefan thanking the store for donating a side of their building for a mural of her and her husband Emilio Estefan, his mother, Carmen Cristina Torres, reminisced about the original store in Miami: 

“It was a wooden house located further down the street. We used to do all the tricks and jokes (more like pranks) in that same wooden house. Precisely because it was a house made out of wood, the whole structure moved if people inside jumped, which happened a lot when we did the prank of the ‘snakes in a jar.’ I had to shout: ‘Don’t move!’ ‘Don’t move!’ It was scary. Later on, thank God and with time, we were able to collect enough money to buy off the land.” 

Era una casita de madera allá adelante. Entonces nosotros en esa casita de madera hacíamos todas las bromas y todas las cosas. Pero, como era de madera, sí habrías una de esas latas de las de dónde saltan cosas la gente, cuando lo veía venir, brincaba. Y la casita se movía. Y yo tenía que gritar: “¡No se muevan!” “¡No se muevan!” El miedo. Pero por lo demás, gracias a Dios y con el tiempo recolectamos dinero y compramos la tierra. 

Sometime later, the wooden house from the original Miami La Casa de los Trucos was replaced by the current building on Eighth Street. 

According to Carmen Cristina Torres, Esteban also had family associated with the Casa de los Trucos in Old Havana: 

He had family who were from La Casa de los Trucos in Old Havana. 

Therefore, he said, “Let’s put it up [here].” 

Porque él tenía la familia de él que era de La Casa de los Trucos de La Habana Vieja. 

Entonces dijo: “Vamos a ponerla.” 

It wasn’t a simple feat to open up the house of tricks. He was one of millions of Cubans who fled Cuba’s communism – and in his own story, he was threatened with his life by shots from Cuban authorities as he escaped on boat. He did not know English when he came to the country and worked several jobs to create a living in the United States. Jorge recalled that his father lived in a car in order to make it to his different shifts and jobs – when Esteban founded La Casa de los Trucos, he would return from a night shift as an x-ray technician to work the store during the day.  

La Casa de los Trucos has been a landmark in Miami for so long that it’s considered a million years by Miami’s length of history (the city was founded in 1896). For nearly half the time Miami has been an officially named city, La Casa de los Trucos in South Florida has existed. On episode 169 of Pero Let Me Tell You! Cuban-American podcasters Ismael Llano and Darien Borges joke about the longevity and cultural prowess of La Casa de los Trucos in the fabric of Miami’s community: 
 
“Right now there is only one, but at one point there were three… The Casa de los Trucos is exactly what it says it is… It’s a store during Halloween [where] they’ll sell costumes, they’ll sell magic tricks and pranks… Whoopee cushions… and it’s a very much Miami institution. It’s been open for like a thousand years.” Ismael laughs. “I think it was open before Miami became incorporated. I hope the one on Eighth street is open for a hundred more years.”

	It’s no surprise that La Casa de los Trucos has been in the community for so long. It was, after all, founded by a man who made laughter a choice of career. Two of the other oldest Cuban-founded businesses in Calle Ocho, Optica Lopez and Los Pinarenos, have fond memories of the entrepreneur. Through their recollections, we understand not only the history and importance of La Casa de los Trucos, but also of a Latino solidarity that defines Little Havana’s identity. In recent years, new waves of immigrants from predominantly Central American countries such as El Salvadore and Nicaragua have made appearances in neighborhoods like Little Havana.
