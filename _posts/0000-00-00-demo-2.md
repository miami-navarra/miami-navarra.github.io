## Introduction

Since May 21, we have come to know Miami as a multicultural city, where immigrant communities make up 27% of the total population. Walking through the streets, the socioeconomic clash and the differences between social classes are clearly visible. Classism, elitism and racial segregation are observed in each and every neighborhood in Miami.

Neighborhoods such as Coconut Grove are a clear example of this social division, where people not only live together by nationality, but also by race. At the beginning of the street, the houses are small, one-story, where the humble nature of their owners predominates over the luxurious and extravagant. The pavement, visibly cracked, makes walking difficult. These conditions are also seen in the cemetery in the middle of the street, which has no protection other than a small fence of no more than 30 centimeters. This humility quickly gives way to luxury. The adjoining street is enclosed by a wooden fence that divides the African-American neighborhood from the Caucasian neighborhood. The streets in this new section enjoy noticeably better structural differences, such as nicely paved streets, houses with more than two stories on both sides, and with some higher-end cars than previously seen. 

## Amy:

During our time in Miami, we learned that a new law that targets immigrant communities was recently passed. We ventured south to learn more about this law, its expected impact, and long term consequences for those who will be directly affected. Senate Bill 1718 could trigger the repatriation of anyone who has failed to get their papers in order. It was passed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, and will go into effect on July 1st. According to Wendy, representative of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, this law will affect the most vulnerable communities, especially construction and agricultural workers. However, the havoc that this law will cause when it becomes effective can already be felt in these types of jobs. While in Homestead we spoke to a Jamaican fruit vendor who expressed, “Yesterday, a farmer came to us fruit vendors while we were picking up and he asked us if we would be willing to go work his farm for the day. None of his workers showed up.” When asked if any of the vendors went, she responded with a chuckle and said, “No.”

Although this fear and uncertainty can be felt throughout the immigrant community, people are not giving up hope without a fight and hoping to vindicate themselves in the process. A clear example of this resilience is embodied in Amy, a 25 year old Indigenous Guatemalan woman who has dedicated the last 7 years of her life to chasing the American dream. Amy and her family received us in their home in Homestead, located south of Miami. From the moment she reached in 2016 she has worked in various occupations, beginning with work in a plant nursery. Now, she is a small business owner who operates a food truck selling Guatemalan staples. She has a robust social media following, 200,000 and counting, where she promotes her business and documents her life in Homestead. From the moment we entered her, the family made us feel welcomed, offering us water, Powerade and mangos. As we got to know Amy we discovered that she walked from Guatemala to Mexico, a journey she laments to discuss. She now focuses on the future of her business, family, and completing her process of becoming an American citizen as she is on the pathway through political asylum. We enjoyed our time with Amy, who we believed embodied the American Dream.
