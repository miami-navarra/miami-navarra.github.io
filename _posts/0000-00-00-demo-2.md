## Introduction

"We come running from something that is wrong, to get to the same story". These are the words of Anibal, a Guatemalan immigrant who chose to suffer the hardships of migrating to an unknown country to seek a second chance far from home. 

Since May 21, we have come to know Miami as a multicultural city, where immigrant communities make up 27% of the total population. Walking through the streets, the socioeconomic clash and the differences between social classes are clearly visible. Classism, elitism and racial segregation are observed in each and every neighborhood in the state of Florida.

Neighborhoods such as Coconut Grove are a clear example of this social division, where people not only live together by nationality, but also by race. At the beginning of the street, the houses are small, one-story, where the humble nature of their owners predominates over the luxurious and extravagant. The pavement, just as cracked, makes walking even more difficult. These conditions are also seen in the cemetery in the middle of the street, which has no protection other than a small fence of no more than 30 centimeters. This humility quickly gives way to luxury. The adjoining street is enclosed by a wooden fence that divides the African-American neighborhood from the Caucasian neighborhood. The streets in this new section enjoy better quality pavement, which gives way to houses with more than two stories on both sides, and with some higher-end cars than previously seen.
